0.  According to Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary, pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a 
pneumoconiosis caused by inhalation of very fine
silicate or quartz dust.
1.  getrusage returns resource usage statistics for a define process/thread. 
2.  I counted 16.
3.  This doesn't look like a functionality problem this so probably to save a small amount of resources by not having to load the 
variables into a function every time it's run. 
4.  The for loop takes the first character from the text file (and then each subsequent character) until it reaches the end of the file. 
Inside this loop, there are a number of conditions to consider. The first looks at whether the character is alphabetic or an
apostrophe (not at the first letter of the word). If so, add the character to a temporary array storing that word. If the word is 
longer than a predefined limit, ignore the rest of the word. If the word has any numbers, ignore it and move to the next word. If
neither of these conditions are reached, we are at a space, so this array now stores a full word, so store a null character, /o and
increase the counter for number of words. Use the function to check whether the word exists in a dictionary + benchmark this function. 
If it's mispelled, print the word. Start the new word. 
5.  fscanf isn't as flexible, for a number of reasons. With fscanf you have to prepare a buffer, so the data you're reading from
must be well structured. It's far more sensible to use fgetc as in the program and then just check if it's alphabetic etc. 
6.  These are declared as constants so as to not change the dictionary or word we are pointing to.
